                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Each team of four marbles roll down a 5 cm wide track without walls. When a marble falls off the track, its distance from the start of the track is the number of points it receives. If a marble reaches the end of the track, it earns 150 points. Each marble's point score is added to give a final team score. The team with the most points wins.

                        In each round, two teams of four marbles each roll down a 20 meter long oval shaped track for six laps. The team that reaches the finish first wins the race and moves on to the next round. The time is based on the fastest three marbles in each team. If a team has two false starts or the distance between marbles is too far, then they are disqualified.

                    <p>
                        The biathlon is a relay race. Each marble rolls down a section of the Gravitrax track before colliding into its team member. The final marble finishes by rolling onto a colored grid, with the further colors being worth more points. The total score is equal to the teams time minus the number of points gained from the colored grid.

                        In rafting, the teams sail down a stream of water in rafts one at a time. The team with the fastest time wins. If a marble falls out of the raft, the team gets 1 penalty second added to their time. If a raft gets stuck on the course, the team gets 2 extra attempts.

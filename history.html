                <h1>
                    The history of the MarbleLympics
                </h1>
                <p>
                    The history of the marbleLympics is storied and dramatic, filled with unexpected turnarounds, dazzling displays of athletiscism and even some unfourtunate controversy. Bellow is an overview of the games as a whole as well as some particularly polarizing moments from them
                </p>
                <h2>
                    MarbleLympics 2016
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 2016 Marblelympics was the first edition of the MarbleLympics and consisted of 16 teams and 12 events. This season had no Qualification Rounds, and thus no teams were cut. This season featured a different scoring system thatn later seasons in it 9th place and under recieved no points, 7th and 8th place recieved 1 point each, 6th through 3rd place recieved 2,3,4 and 5 points respectivley, 2 place recieved 7 points and 1st place recieved 10 points. This system however was seen as unecesarily punishing and complex and so was changed for later seasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The opening ceremony featured each of the sixteen teams coming out one by one before lining up in a grid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the season, it was the Savage Speeders who were victorious, but Mellow Yellow, Thunderbolts, and Team Momo were very close behind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the  memorable moments of this season included
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In Event 5: Long jump the world record for long Jump which was 93.8 cm, was broken multiple times during the event. Firstly Mo from Team Momo broke the record with a jump of 97.3 cm. Then it was broken by Bolta from the Thunderbolts with a jump of 97.6 cm. Finally it was broken by Kinnowin of the O'rangers with a jump of 103.8 cm.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A controversy over scoring in the Quartet diving event over the scoring system which resulted in the event not being used in future seasons
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The closing ceremony started with all of the teams lining up on a set of stairs starting with the 16th placed Pinkies at the bottom up to the 1st placed Savage Speeders at the top. The Savage Speeders then came off the top of the stair into a Hubelino track. They rolled down the track and knocked into a domino which set off a chain reaction of dominoes and blocks which set off a chain reaction of clothes pegs and dominoes which jumped into the air.

                <h2>
                    MarbleLympics 2017
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The 2017 MarbleLympics instituted a number of changes over the previous year, firstly it instituted an Qualifiers system with the top four finishers from 2016 guaranteed a spot and 16 teams competing in the qualifiers for the remaining 12 spots, 2017 also allowed fans to view the games live with statiums being set up for each event , the games also instituted a simplified scoring system with only last place recieving no points, 15th through 4th place recieving 1-12 points, and 1st 2nd and 3rd place recieving 15, 20 and 25 points respectivley.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This opening ceremony featured a procession of the MarbleLympic torch followed by each of the 16 competing teams down a straightaway in front of all of the spectating marbles. The torch was then carried up the steps and was used to light the MarbleLympics cauldron.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This season was dominated by the first place O'rangers and 2 place Savage Speedsters who each finished with over 30 points more then the third place Mellow Yellows
                </p>
                <p>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Hurdles event featured the closest finish in MarbleLympics history with a margin of just .03 seconds separating first and second place
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        un unpopular disqualification in the Relay run event resulting in a brawl in the stands that had to be broken up by security

                    <li>
                        A number of instances of members of the crowd rushing the field, with one notable fan attempting the Block Pushing event before being escorted out by security
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The closing ceremony started with a procession of all the participating teams in order from the 16th placed Quicksilvers through to the 4th placed Midnight Wisps. A red carpet was then laid out in front of the podium and the top three teams made their way onto the podium, starting with 3rd place Mellow Yellow, then 2nd placed Savage Speeders and finally the winners of MarbleLympics 2017 the O'rangers. Then the teams that failed to qualify for the tournament processed out in front of the podium. The O'rangers were then led up some stairs and one member of the team went into a Hubelino track. They then went through a funnel before setting off a chain reaction of dominoes and other marbles which led to the extinguishing of the MarbleLympics flame.

                <p>
                    The 2018 Winter Marble League was the first winter edition of the Marble League. It contained all new events including Bobsleigh, Curling, Ski Jump, Ice Hockey (like Collision) and other winter-based disciplines. The final tournament contained 12 events where 16 teams competed to win medals and points. The scoring system remained the same as in the 2017 Marble League. This was the very first Marble League to feature a fixed "host". This trend continues to be featured in successive Marble League editions. The Snowballs were the host team for the 2018 Winter Marble League. Located in The Arctic Circle, their arena was run by the IMC, but was home to the Snowballs and the Snowballs' Royal Family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The opening ceremony started with a procession to March of the Snowflakes by Mellacus. The procession was led by the Icicle King and the Icicle Queen, followed by the members of the International Marble Sport Committee. The competing teams then processed out to meet the King and Queen before lining up with the IMC. The host team, the Snowballs came out last with the MarbleLympic flame. They then carried the flame up the steps to and lit the MarbleLympic Flame, officially starting the MarbleLympics. The anthem of the Snowballs was then played.

                <p>
                    This Season Was a close competition with the Midnight Wisps pulling out a narrow victory over the Savage Speedstersin the end and the Oceanics coming in a somewhat more distant 3rd place

                        Team Momo's run of bad luck continued even after the triumphant return of team captain Momo, in the Bobsled race two members of the team were forced to pull out due to altitude sickness and a head injury respectively. One member was replaced by an alternate still leaving them down a man, because of this Team Momo chose to merge with team Primary who had not qualified renaming themselves Momary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The curling event was delayed multiple times due to disagreements between the members of the IMC as to whether it should be allowed in at all. originally slated to be event 3 it was pushed back to event 9 with some rule changes in place as compromises between committee members.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This Season featured the first course not wholly designed by Commissioner Bakker, the course for the Biathlon event was made by German Company Gravitrax with the input of Bakker as part of a sponsorship.

                    About This Site
                </h1>
                <h2>
                    So what exactly is all this?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    This is a site based around the fictional sport of Marble runs created by a Dutch man named Jelle Bakker in 2006. Bakkar originally made videos on Youtube of marbles moving down tracks that he built himself which gradually became more and more elaborate until he eventually broke the world record for "longest marble run" in 2009. In 2016 Jelle started releasing a new series called the MarbleLympics which operated under a form of
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe">
                        "Kayfabe"
                    </a>
                    , essentially the games were treated as entirely real sporting events with the marbles treated as human competitors. This extends even to the point of having "fans" in stands around the track and in some cases "fistfights" between teams. All of this is conveyed by   stop-motion movement of the marbles and commentary by Greg Woods, a friend of Bakker,  in the style of a sports event.  Most to all fan content also takes part in this Kayfabe and for the sake of continuity with my sources I will be doing so on the rest of the site as well.
                </p>
                <h2>
                    Who would be this into marbles?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Well that person is Jelle Bakker. Bakker was born in WerverShoof, Netherlands and has stated that he has a form of autism that makes watching moving colors extremely soothing. Bakker has stated that due to his Autism he is unable to have a job and  because of this spent a great deal of his time constructing "Marble machines" which he eventually started posting to Youtube. After he started posting videos in a race format one of his fans uploaded a remix of one video with Olympics style commentary over it, which was extremely popular. Greg Woods, the fan in question, started working with Bakker as his commentator shortly afterwards.

                <p>
                    The Production value of the series has increased drastically over time with the current videos boasting high speed instant replays to determine the winner of a race down to the hundredth of a second. Bakker's youtube channel currently has over 500,000 subscribers and was even featured on ESPN8 in August 2019.

                <h3>
                    Okay but why did
                    <b>
                        you
                    </b>
                    make this site?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This site was made as part of Level 02 of Holberton School's application process. I chose to make this site as making a page about a fictional sport seemed to allow for a greater degree of creativity than making a page about myself or something of the like. I had heard of the Marblelympics but never actually watched any videos and it seemed like a good option. After watching some video's and exploring the community somewhat however I was blown away by the level of passion and creativity involved. The original intent of the site was to poke fun at the show to a degree. I was going to go for a super intense pro wrestling type feel to the site to poke fun at the absurdity of it. As the project went on though that seemed more and more unnecessary, this was a phenomenon with a wealth of character all its own that would be much more interesting to show than a shallow mockery. I hope I've managed to get all that across and I hope you enjoy learning about Jelle's marble runs.
